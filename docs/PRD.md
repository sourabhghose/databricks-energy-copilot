# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
# AUS Energy Copilot — Phase 1: Market Intelligence & AI Assistant

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 19 February 2026
**Author:** Sourabh Ghose
**Status:** Draft

---

## 1. Executive Summary

AUS Energy Copilot is an AI-powered market intelligence and trading assistant for the Australian National Electricity Market (NEM). Phase 1 delivers a real-time market analytics platform (comparable to NemSight) combined with a conversational AI copilot — built entirely on Databricks-native technologies.

The product ingests open-source data from AEMO/NEMWEB, OpenElectricity, and Bureau of Meteorology weather feeds, processes it through a medallion lakehouse architecture, and serves it through three interfaces: interactive dashboards, natural language Genie analytics, and an AI agent copilot.

**Target users:** Energy traders, portfolio analysts, market analysts, and trading desk managers operating in the Australian NEM. Phase 4 extends to Distribution Network Service Providers (DNSPs) with network operations, DER management, and reliability analytics.

---

## 2. Problem Statement

### Current Pain Points

1. **Fragmented market data**: Traders juggle multiple tools (NEMWEB portal, spreadsheets, NemSight, custom scripts) to piece together a market view. There is no unified platform combining prices, generation, weather, and constraints.

2. **Reactive, not predictive**: Existing tools like NemSight show what *happened*. Traders need to know what *will* happen — price spikes, demand surges, renewable generation shortfalls — before they occur.

3. **Manual analysis bottleneck**: Understanding *why* a price spiked requires manually correlating outages, weather events, interconnector constraints, and demand patterns across multiple data sources. This takes experienced analysts 30-60 minutes per event.

4. **No natural language access**: Non-technical stakeholders (risk managers, executives) cannot self-serve market analytics without requesting analyst support.

5. **High tool costs**: Commercial solutions like NemSight + EOT can cost $50K-$200K+ per year in licensing. An open-data, Databricks-native solution reduces this significantly for teams already on the platform.

### Opportunity

Build an AI-first market intelligence platform that:
- Unifies all NEM market data in a governed lakehouse
- Provides predictive intelligence (price/demand/generation forecasts)
- Enables natural language interaction with market data
- Delivers proactive AI-driven insights and alerts
- Runs entirely on Databricks, leveraging existing platform investment

## 3. Target Users & Personas

### P1: Energy Trader (Primary)
- **Goal**: Make profitable trading decisions quickly
- **Needs**: Real-time prices, generation mix, interconnector flows, price forecasts, competitor bidstack analysis, alerts on price spikes
- **AI Copilot Use**: "What's the SA spot price forecast for 4-6pm today?", "Why did QLD price spike at 2pm?", "Show me the bidstack changes for Bayswater in the last hour"

### P2: Market Analyst (Primary)
- **Goal**: Produce market reports and identify trends
- **Needs**: Historical analysis, cross-regional comparisons, seasonal patterns, renewable penetration trends, demand correlations
- **AI Copilot Use**: "Compare average peak prices across all regions for Q4 2025 vs Q4 2024", "What's the correlation between wind generation and SA prices?"

### P3: Risk / Portfolio Manager (Secondary)
- **Goal**: Monitor portfolio exposure to market movements
- **Needs**: Price volatility metrics, regional risk profiles, interconnector congestion patterns, demand forecast accuracy
- **AI Copilot Use**: "What was the volatility in VIC prices this week?", "Summarize interconnector congestion events in the last month"

### P4: Trading Desk Manager / Executive (Secondary)
- **Goal**: High-level market overview without technical complexity
- **Needs**: Daily market summaries, key metrics dashboard, trend alerts
- **AI Copilot Use**: "Give me a morning market brief", "What were the key market events yesterday?"

>
> **Copilot**: "The current SA spot price is $87/MWh. My forecast for the next 4 hours:
> - 2:30pm: $92/MWh (↑ rising demand, wind dropping)
> - 3:00pm: $105/MWh (↑ afternoon peak approaching)
> - 3:30pm: $118/MWh (↑ peak demand, low wind)
> - 4:00pm: $135/MWh (↑ evening ramp, solar declining)
> - 4:30pm: $142/MWh (↑ peak — solar offline, wind still low)
> - 5:00pm: $128/MWh (↓ demand easing)
>
> Key drivers: BOM forecasts wind speed dropping to 8 km/h across SA wind farms by 3pm. Temperature forecast of 38°C in Adelaide driving aircon load. Heywood interconnector currently at 85% capacity."

**Analyst at 9am:**
> **User**: "Give me a morning market brief"
>
> **Copilot**: "NEM Morning Brief — 19 Feb 2026:
>
> **Overnight**: Prices were subdued across all regions. NSW averaged $52/MWh, VIC $48/MWh, QLD $55/MWh, SA $61/MWh, TAS $44/MWh.
>
> **Key events**: Loy Yang A Unit 2 returned from outage at 04:00 AEST (500MW). SA wind generation averaged 1,200MW overnight (65% capacity factor).
>
> **Today's outlook**: Hot day forecast — Adelaide 39°C, Sydney 34°C. Expect afternoon price spikes in SA (forecast peak $180/MWh at 5pm) and NSW ($120/MWh). QNI interconnector maintenance reducing capacity by 200MW until 6pm.
>
> **Watch items**: SA evening peak risk — low wind forecast + high temp = potential $300+ price if Heywood congests."

# Phase 2: Lightweight ETRM — Trading & Risk

**Estimated Duration:** 12-16 weeks (following Phase 1 completion)
**Prerequisites:** Phase 1 fully operational (data pipelines, dashboard, copilot, Genie)

---

## 14. Phase 2 — Executive Summary

Phase 2 transforms AUS Energy Copilot from a market intelligence tool into an active **trading support platform** by adding deal capture, portfolio tracking, forward curve management, risk analytics, PPA valuation, and FCAS market support. This directly addresses the gentailer workflow: traders can now ask the copilot "what's my exposure?" — not just "what's the market doing?"

The phase targets the core gap identified in Phase 1 for gentailer customers like Alinta Energy and Energy Australia: connecting market intelligence to **portfolio positions**.

---

## 15. Phase 2 — Product Scope

### 15.1 Deal Capture & Portfolio Management

#### Deal Capture UI
- **Trade entry forms** in Streamlit for common NEM contract types:
  - Spot exposure (generation/load positions by region)
  - OTC forwards and swaps (flat, peak, off-peak, super-peak profiles)
  - Futures (ASX Energy futures — base, peak, cap contracts)
  - Options (caps, floors, collars on NEM regional prices)
  - Power Purchase Agreements (fixed price, CPI-escalated, floor/cap, pay-as-produced, baseload-shaped)
  - Renewable Energy Certificates (LGCs, STCs)
- **AI-assisted deal entry**: Copilot can create trades from natural language ("Enter a 50MW peak swap for VIC Q3 2026 at $85/MWh")
- **Bulk import** via CSV upload for existing portfolio migration
- **Trade amendment and cancellation** with full audit trail

#### Portfolio Views
- **Position summary**: Net long/short by region, time bucket (month, quarter, year), and contract type
- **Portfolio P&L**: Realized + unrealized, broken down by trade, region, and contract type
- **Exposure heatmap**: Visual grid of MW exposure by region x time period, color-coded by direction and size
- **Trade blotter**: Filterable/sortable list of all trades with status, counterparty, volume, price, and current MtM value

#### Data Model (Lakebase)

| Table | Key Columns | Purpose |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| `trades` | trade_id, trade_type, region, buy_sell, volume_mw, price, start_date, end_date, profile, status, counterparty, created_by, created_at | Master trade record |

- **MtM methodology**:
  - Forwards/swaps: Sum of (forward price − contract price) × volume × discount factor per settlement period
  - Options: Black-76 model for European-style caps/floors; intrinsic + time value decomposition
  - PPAs: Hourly cashflow projection using shaped forward curves × forecast generation profile, discounted to NPV
  - RECs: Current spot/forward LGC price × certificate volume
- **P&L attribution**: Decompose daily P&L change into price move, volume change, curve roll, new trades, and time decay

- **Stress testing**: Pre-defined scenarios:
  - "SA heatwave" (SA price +300%, demand +20%)
  - "Wind drought" (wind gen -80% across NEM for 48 hours)
  - "Coal trip" (2GW unplanned outage in NSW)
  - "Interconnector failure" (Heywood or QNI capacity = 0)
  - Custom user-defined scenarios

#### Credit Risk
- Counterparty exposure tracking against credit limits
- Alerts when exposure exceeds 80% of credit limit
- Counterparty exposure aging (current, 30-day, 90-day)

### 15.4 PPA Valuation Copilot

#### AI-Powered PPA Analysis
- **Copilot PPA tool**: `value_ppa(strike_price, term_years, technology, region, profile, escalation, volume_mw)`
- **Valuation approach**:
  - Project hourly generation profile using technology-specific shape (solar, wind) and regional capacity factors
  - Apply shaped forward curves to calculate merchant revenue baseline
  - Calculate PPA cashflows: (strike price − merchant price) × forecast generation per hour
  - Discount to NPV using configurable WACC
  - Run Monte Carlo simulation (1,000 paths) varying price, generation, and correlation to produce NPV distribution
- **Key outputs**: Expected NPV, P10/P50/P90 NPV range, breakeven strike price, capture price discount, annual cashflow profile
- **Copilot conversation example**:
  > "Value a 10-year solar PPA in SA at $55/MWh with 2.5% CPI escalation, 100MW nameplate"
  >
  > Copilot returns NPV range, capture price analysis, sensitivity table, and recommendation

# Phase 4: Network Operations & Distribution Intelligence

**Estimated Duration:** 14-20 weeks (following Phase 3 completion)
**Prerequisites:** Phase 1 operational (market data, forecasting, copilot)

---

## 18. Phase 4 — Executive Summary

Phase 4 extends AUS Energy Copilot beyond the wholesale market to serve **Distribution Network Service Providers (DNSPs)** — the poles-and-wires businesses that deliver electricity to homes and businesses. This phase adds network asset monitoring, DER (Distributed Energy Resource) visibility, outage analytics, regulatory compliance dashboards, and network planning tools. It positions the platform for a new customer segment: DNSPs like Ausgrid, Endeavour Energy, SA Power Networks, Ergon Energy, CitiPower/Powercor, and AusNet Services.

DNSPs face mounting pressure from rooftop solar proliferation, battery adoption, EV charging load growth, and increasing AEMO/AER regulatory requirements. Their existing SCADA/ADMS systems generate vast volumes of data but lack the AI-driven analytics layer to convert network telemetry into actionable intelligence. AUS Energy Copilot fills this gap by bringing lakehouse analytics, AI forecasting, and a conversational copilot to the distribution network.
