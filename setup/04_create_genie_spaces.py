# AUS Energy Copilot — Create Genie Spaces via Databricks SDK
#
# Creates 3 Genie Spaces for natural-language analytics over Gold tables:
#   1. NEM Prices & Demand
#   2. Generation & Fuel Mix
#   3. Interconnectors & Constraints
#
# Each space is configured with:
#   - Gold tables as data sources
#   - Semantic layer: table descriptions, column descriptions, glossary terms
#   - Sample questions / benchmark queries for accuracy validation
#   - Curated metrics definitions
#
# Prerequisites:
#   - Databricks SDK installed: pip install databricks-sdk
#   - Authenticated: DATABRICKS_HOST and DATABRICKS_TOKEN set, or use
#     profile-based auth: databricks auth login --host <workspace-url>
#   - Unity Catalog energy_copilot.gold schema populated (run 02_create_tables.sql first)
#   - Caller must have CAN MANAGE on the target workspace folder
#
# Usage (run as a Databricks notebook or locally with credentials):
#   databricks-connect run 04_create_genie_spaces.py
