## 1. Executive Summary

AUS Energy AI Market Intelligence is an AI-powered market intelligence and trading assistant for the Australian National Electricity Market (NEM). Phase 1 delivers a real-time market analytics platform (comparable to NemSight) combined with a conversational AI assistant — built entirely on Databricks-native technologies.

The product ingests open-source data from AEMO/NEMWEB, OpenElectricity, and Bureau of Meteorology weather feeds, processes it through a medallion lakehouse architecture, and serves it through three interfaces: interactive dashboards, natural language Genie analytics, and an AI Market Intelligence agent.

**Target users:** Energy traders, portfolio analysts, market analysts, and trading desk managers operating in the Australian NEM. Phase 4 extends to Distribution Network Service Providers (DNSPs) with network operations, DER management, and reliability analytics.

## 2. Problem Statement

### Current Pain Points

1. **Fragmented market data**: Traders juggle multiple tools (NEMWEB portal, spreadsheets, NemSight, custom scripts) to piece together a market view. There is no unified platform combining prices, generation, weather, and constraints.

2. **Reactive, not predictive**: Existing tools like NemSight show what *happened*. Traders need to know what *will* happen — price spikes, demand surges, renewable generation shortfalls — before they occur.

3. **Manual analysis bottleneck**: Understanding *why* a price spiked requires manually correlating outages, weather events, interconnector constraints, and demand patterns across multiple data sources. This takes experienced analysts 30-60 minutes per event.

4. **No natural language access**: Non-technical stakeholders (risk managers, executives) cannot self-serve market analytics without requesting analyst support.

5. **High tool costs**: Commercial solutions like NemSight + EOT can cost $50K-$200K+ per year in licensing. An open-data, Databricks-native solution reduces this significantly for teams already on the platform.

### Opportunity

Build an AI-first market intelligence platform that:
- Unifies all NEM market data in a governed lakehouse
- Provides predictive intelligence (price/demand/generation forecasts)
- Enables natural language interaction with market data
- Delivers proactive AI-driven insights and alerts
- Runs entirely on Databricks, leveraging existing platform investment

- [x] On anomaly detection, auto-generates causal explanation by correlating:
  - Generator trips/outages (generation drop detection)
  - Interconnector congestion (flow at or near limit)
  - Weather extremes (temperature > 38°C or < 5°C, wind speed < 5km/h)
  - Tight supply-demand balance (demand/available > 90%)
  - Price volatility spikes (max > 3× average in window)
- [ ] Push explanation to alert channels (deferred — currently in-app only)
- [x] Store explanations in `gold.anomaly_explanations` for historical analysis and caching

- **Implementation**: `market_briefs.py` router with `_generate_brief_core()` — queries 24h price stats, anomaly events, renewable share, interconnector congestion, weather. Builds markdown narrative (Overnight Summary, Key Events, Today's Outlook, Watch Items). Persists to `gold.market_briefs`. `MarketBriefs.tsx` archive page + `LatestBriefWidget` on Home page (collapsible card with "View all briefs →" link).
- **Competitive note**: **No incumbent offers AI-generated briefs.** Traders currently spend 30-60 min writing morning briefs manually. This saves 5+ hours/week per trading desk.

2. **[DONE] Create views** mapping accelerator gold tables to `energy_copilot_catalog.gold`:
   - `gold.nem_prices_5min` (167K rows), `gold.nem_generation_by_fuel` (968K rows), `gold.nem_interconnectors` (167K rows), `gold.nem_facilities` (650 rows), `gold.nem_region_summary` (3.5K rows)
   - **[DONE 2026-03-06]** `gold.nem_bid_stack` (11.5M rows) — bid price/volume by DUID/band/interval, joined with facilities for region/fuel metadata
   - **[DONE 2026-03-06]** `gold.nem_bid_statistics` (12 rows) — aggregated bid metrics per region
3. **Keep our weather + solar pipelines** — the accelerator doesn't cover Open-Meteo or APVI API
4. **[DONE] App layer reads from gold views** — ~61 endpoints wired to real data across 8 router files
5. **Retire** `nemweb_downloader.py`, `01_nemweb_ingest.py`, `00_historical_backfill.py` — superseded
6. **ML models deployed** but tables not yet populated (training jobs need to be triggered)

#### Key Benefits

- **5x more NEMWEB data** — fills Tier 1 gaps (bids, FCAS, constraints, predispatch, STPASA, MTPASA, rooftop PV, demand forecasts)
- **Production-grade SDP** — declarative, serverless, schema evolution tracking, DQ checks
- **DABs deployment** — reproducible, CI/CD-ready, multi-environment
- **Built-in ML** — demand forecasting + price spike classification out of the box

#### Caveats

- **Private repo** (Databricks License) — confirm internal reuse rights
- **Depends on forked OpenElectricity SDK** — custom wheel with PySpark integration (PR #14 pending merge to upstream)
- **Phase 3 streaming not fully deployed** — current folder scanning code written but wheel not rebuilt
- **Gold table names differ** from ours — need views or rename to maintain API compatibility
- **Azure workspace** (original) — needs testing on AWS (our workspace is AWS `fevm-energy-copilot`)

### 5.5 Data Gap Action Plan — Progress Tracker

**Current state (2026-03-07):** ~410 endpoints serve real data (305 auto-stubs + ~85 hand-wired + ~20 deal CRUD), ~160 generic mock, 7 labeled illustrative. Bundle deploys end-to-end with `databricks bundle deploy`.

#### Step 1: Deploy NEMWEB Solution Accelerator — COMPLETED (2026-03-05 / 2026-03-06)

**Unlocked:** ~75 endpoints serving real NEMWEB data

**Completed:**
- [x] Deployed `australian-energy-nemweb-analytics` DAB to `energy_copilot_catalog.nemweb_analytics` (78 tables)
- [x] Created gold views in `energy_copilot_catalog.gold` (nem_prices_5min, nem_generation_by_fuel, nem_interconnectors, nem_facilities, nem_region_summary)
- [x] Fixed BIDPEROFFER_D OOM: streaming CSV parser (`_parse_csv_streaming()`) + 10K-row chunked RecordBatch yielding for serverless 1GB limit
- [x] Created bid gold views: `gold.nem_bid_stack` (11.5M rows), `gold.nem_bid_statistics` (12 rows)
- [x] Wired ~61 endpoints across 8 router files (Step 1a+1b)
- [x] Wired 4 batch_forecasting.py endpoints to ML forecast gold tables (price_forecasts, demand_forecasts, demand_actuals)
- [x] Wired 6 stubs.py endpoints (spot-forecast, stpasa-adequacy, aemo-market-ops, settlement, vpp, planned-outage)
- [x] Wired 3 batch_bidding.py endpoints (market-bidding-strategy, wholesale-bidding-strategy, system-operator via anomaly_events)

**Key technical fix:** NEMWEB `Bidmove_Complete` files contain BIDPEROFFER_D with ~600K+ rows per day. The default CSV parser loaded everything into memory, hitting the 1GB serverless UDF limit. Fixed by adding a streaming generator that yields row dicts one at a time and batches into 10K-row Arrow RecordBatches.

#### Step 2: Add Settlement & SRA Ingestion (2-3 days)

**Unlocks:** ~11 endpoints (Settlement Analytics, 5-Min Settlement, SRA Analytics, Congestion Revenue)

| Data | Source | Method |
|---|---|---|
| Settlement statements (trading amounts, FCAS payments) | NEMWEB `/Reports/Current/Settlements/` | CSV ZIP download — same pattern as dispatch. Add to accelerator's `NemwebArrowDataSource` or standalone notebook |
| SRA auction results | NEMWEB `/Reports/Current/SRA_Results/` | CSV ZIP download — bronze table, aggregate to gold |

#### Step 3: Add AEMO Market Notices API (1 day)

**Unlocks:** ~3 endpoints (Market Events, Market Notices, Alerts)

| Data | Source | Method |
|---|---|---|
| Market notices (LOR, directions, interventions) | AEMO Market Notices API (`api.aemo.com.au`) | REST API → JSON → Delta. Paginated GET, ~100 notices/day. Free, public |

#### Step 4: ASX Energy Futures — Free End-of-Day Prices (2 days)

**Unlocks:** ~15 of 27 futures/hedging endpoints (futures dashboard, forward curves, price discovery, hedging portfolio)

| Data | Source | Method |
|---|---|---|
| Base/peak/cap futures settlement prices | ASX Energy (`asxenergy.com.au/futures_au`) | Free end-of-day CSV with 20-min delay. Daily scrape → bronze → gold. Covers base load, peak, $300 cap contracts for NSW, QLD, VIC, SA |
| Options data (Greeks, OI, vol surface) | ASX Energy (paid) or Bloomberg/Refinitiv | **Not available free** — keep synthetic for 12 options-specific endpoints, label as "illustrative" |

**Note:** Forward curves can also be derived from AEMO settlement file contract data (Step 2), providing a second independent source.

#### Step 5: Static Lookup Tables (2 days)

**Unlocks:** ~8 endpoints (Carbon/Emissions, DER, Sustainability)

| Data | Source | Method | Refresh |
|---|---|---|---|
| Emissions factors (NGA scope 2, kg CO2/MWh per fuel) | DCEEW National Greenhouse Accounts | One-time CSV load, ~30 rows | Annual |
| LGC/STC certificate prices | CER LGC Registry + ASX Environmental | End-of-day scrape or manual CSV | Daily/weekly |
| DER Register (rooftop PV, battery by postcode) | CER DER Register API (`api.rec-registry.gov.au`) | REST API bulk download, ~1M records | Monthly |
| AER enforcement actions | AER Enforcement Register (web) | Simple scrape, ~50 entries/year | Quarterly |
| Retail DMO/VDO prices | AER Annual Retail Report | Manual XLSX extract | Annual |

#### Step 6: Gas Bulletin Board API (2-3 days)

**Unlocks:** ~1 dashboard (Gas Market)

| Data | Source | Method |
|---|---|---|
| Gas hub prices (Wallumbilla, Sydney, Adelaide, Brisbane) | AEMO GBB API (`api.aemo.com.au/gbb`) | REST API → JSON → Delta. Free, public, well-documented |
| Pipeline flows and capacity | AEMO GBB API | Same endpoint, different data tables |

#### Step 7: Keep Synthetic — Customer-Specific Data (0 days)

**~7 endpoints remain synthetic by design** — these require customer-specific or restricted data:

| Dashboard | Why Synthetic | Path to Real Data |
|---|---|---|
| Credit Risk / Counterparty Exposure | Requires customer's own ETRM/portfolio system | Phase 2 deal capture integration (section 15.1) |
| Cyber Security (OT/ICS) | Requires internal SOC/ASD data | Customer-provided or keep as capability demo |
| Options Greeks / Vol Surface | Requires paid ASX Energy or Bloomberg feed | Customer brings their own market data subscription |
| Retail Market Shares | AER publishes annually as PDF, no API | Manual annual update or keep as illustrative |

#### Estimated Timeline

| Week | Steps | Outcome |
|---|---|---|
| Week 1 | Step 1 (accelerator deployment + views) | ~110 real endpoints |
| Week 2 | Steps 2 + 3 (settlement, SRA, market notices) | ~124 real endpoints |
| Week 3 | Steps 4 + 5 + 6 (ASX futures, static lookups, gas) | ~148 real endpoints |

**Result:** 148 of 155 endpoints serving real data within 3 weeks. The remaining 7 are synthetic by design (customer-specific data).

#### Data Source Summary After Completion

| Source | Endpoints Powered | Access | Cost |
|---|---|---|---|
| NEMWEB (via accelerator) | ~110 | Public, free | $0 |
| NEMWEB (settlement + SRA, new pipelines) | ~11 | Public, free | $0 |
| AEMO Market Notices API | ~3 | Public, free | $0 |
| ASX Energy (free EOD) | ~15 | Public, 20-min delayed | $0 |
| Open-Meteo (existing pipeline) | ~5 | Public, free | $0 |
| APVI (existing pipeline) | ~2 | Public, free | $0 |
| Static lookups (DCEEW, CER, AER) | ~8 | Public, free | $0 |
| AEMO GBB (gas) | ~1 | Public, free | $0 |
| Synthetic (customer-specific) | ~7 | N/A | $0 |
| **Total** | **~155** | | **$0** |

### 5.6 Lakebase Serving Layer — Sub-10ms Dashboard Reads

#### Problem

The 11 real-data endpoints in `home.py` query gold Delta tables via a SQL Warehouse connection. This has two issues:
1. **Latency:** SQL Warehouse queries take 200-800ms (cold start can be seconds), too slow for real-time dashboard UX
2. **Cost:** Every page load spins a SQL Warehouse, even for data that changes only every 5 minutes
3. **Mock endpoints:** The remaining ~145 endpoints serve hardcoded inline mock data with no path to real data without a low-latency read layer

#### Solution: Gold → Synced Tables → Lakebase → FastAPI

```
Gold Delta Tables (analytics)
    ↓ Synced Tables (Continuous mode, ~15s latency)
Lakebase Postgres (OLTP reads)
    ↓ psycopg2 connection pool
FastAPI endpoints (<10ms reads, mock fallback)
```

#### Architecture

**Single snapshot table** — `energy_copilot_catalog.gold.dashboard_snapshots` stores pre-computed JSON payloads keyed by `(endpoint_path, region)`. This avoids creating 155 individual tables.

```sql
CREATE TABLE energy_copilot_catalog.gold.dashboard_snapshots (
    endpoint_path   STRING      NOT NULL,
    region          STRING      NOT NULL DEFAULT 'ALL',
    snapshot_at     TIMESTAMP   NOT NULL,
    payload_json    STRING      NOT NULL,
    CONSTRAINT pk PRIMARY KEY (endpoint_path, region)
) USING DELTA
TBLPROPERTIES ('delta.enableChangeDataFeed' = 'true');
```

**Synced Tables** (GA, replaces deprecated Online Tables) auto-replicate Delta → Lakebase with ~15s latency in Continuous mode. Requires CDF enabled + primary key on the Delta table.

**Lakebase Postgres** serves as the low-latency OLTP read layer. The FastAPI backend connects via a `psycopg2` threaded connection pool (2-10 connections).

#### FastAPI Integration

Three new helpers in `app/routers/shared.py`:

| Helper | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `_get_lakebase_pool()` | Lazy-init psycopg2 `ThreadedConnectionPool` using `LAKEBASE_HOST/PORT/DATABASE/USER/PASSWORD` env vars |
| `_query_lakebase(sql, params)` | Run arbitrary SQL against Lakebase Postgres, return list of dicts (same interface as `_query_gold`) |
| `_query_snapshot(endpoint_path, region)` | Read pre-computed JSON payload from `dashboard_snapshots` table, parse and return, or `None` on miss |

#### Endpoint Rewiring Pattern

Every mock endpoint gets a 3-line addition at the top of the function body. Zero risk — if Lakebase is unavailable, `_query_snapshot()` returns `None` and the endpoint falls through to existing mock logic unchanged.

```python
@router.get("/api/some/endpoint")
async def some_endpoint(region: str = "NSW1"):
    # --- Lakebase snapshot lookup ---
    snap = _query_snapshot("/api/some/endpoint", region)
    if snap is not None:
        return snap
    # --- existing mock logic below (unchanged) ---
    ...
```

**Modules to rewire:**

| Module | Endpoints | Pattern |
|---|---|---|
| `dashboards.py` | 12 | Snapshot lookup before cache/mock |
| `sidebar.py` | 26 | Snapshot lookup, some with `region` param |
| `stubs.py` | 31 | Snapshot lookup before inline mock |
| `market_events.py` | 10 | Snapshot lookup before mock |
| `spike_analysis.py` | 18 | Snapshot lookup before mock |
| `batch_forecasting.py` | 9 | Snapshot lookup before mock |
| `batch_futures_hedging.py` | 27 | Snapshot lookup before mock |
| `batch_bidding.py` | 9 | Snapshot lookup before mock |
| **Total** | **~142** | |

#### Home.py Migration

The 11 real SQL Warehouse endpoints in `home.py` switch from `_query_gold(sql)` to `_query_lakebase(sql)`. The SQL stays the same (both speak PostgreSQL-compatible SQL). The existing mock fallback remains.

#### Mock Data Generator

A Databricks Job (`pipelines/09_dashboard_snapshot_generator.py`) runs every 5 minutes:
1. Generates JSON payloads for all ~155 endpoints (same logic as inline mock, extracted to helper functions)
2. Writes/merges into `gold.dashboard_snapshots` using `MERGE INTO` on `(endpoint_path, region)`
3. Synced Tables replicates to Lakebase within ~15 seconds

As real data pipelines come online (section 5.5), the generator is replaced endpoint-by-endpoint with real aggregations from gold tables.

#### Health Check

`/api/system/health` includes a Lakebase connectivity check:

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `lakebase_ok` | `true` if `SELECT 1` succeeds against Lakebase pool |
| `snapshot_count` | Number of endpoints with active snapshots |
| `snapshot_freshness_seconds` | Age of oldest snapshot |

#### Environment Variables

| Variable | Value | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `LAKEBASE_HOST` | (from Lakebase provisioning) | Postgres host endpoint |
| `LAKEBASE_PORT` | `5432` | Default Postgres port |
| `LAKEBASE_DATABASE` | `energy_copilot` | Lakebase database name |
| `LAKEBASE_USER` | `energy_copilot_app` | Service principal or app user |
| `LAKEBASE_PASSWORD` | (from secret scope) | Connection password |

#### Rollback

Every endpoint retains its full mock logic. If Lakebase is unavailable:
- `_query_snapshot()` returns `None` → endpoint falls through to mock data
- `_query_lakebase()` returns `None` → `home.py` endpoints fall through to existing `_query_gold()` → mock
- Zero-risk deployment with graceful degradation

#### Performance Targets

| Metric | Target | Current (mock) | Current (SQL Warehouse) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Dashboard endpoint latency (p50) | < 10ms | ~2ms (inline mock) | 200-800ms |
| Dashboard endpoint latency (p99) | < 50ms | ~5ms | 2-5s (cold start) |
| Data freshness | < 20 seconds | N/A (static mock) | ~25s (cache TTL) |
| SQL Warehouse dependency for reads | None | None | Required |
| Fallback on Lakebase failure | Mock data | N/A | N/A |

## 13. Competitive Analysis & Differentiation

### 13.1 Competitive Landscape

AUS Energy AI Market Intelligence competes across three market segments, each dominated by different incumbents:

| Segment | Incumbents | Typical Cost | AI Market Intelligence Positioning |
|---------|-----------|-------------|---------------------------|
| **Market Intelligence** | ez2view (Global-Roam), NemSight (Energy One) | $20K–$80K/yr per seat | Parity on data + superior AI/ML layer |
| **ETRM** | SimEnergy, EOT, enTrader (Energy One), Allegro (ION), PCI Energy Solutions | $50K–$500K+/yr | Lightweight-to-enterprise via phased rollout |
| **Bidding & Dispatch** | EnergyOffer (Energy One) | $30K–$100K/yr | AI-optimized alternative (Phase 3) |

### 13.2 Unique Differentiators (No Incumbent Offers These)

| Differentiator | Description | Competitive Moat |
|---------------|-------------|-----------------|
| **AI Market Intelligence (NL→insight)** | Claude Sonnet via FMAPI with 10+ tools — answers "why did SA spike?" by correlating prices, generation, weather, constraints in real-time | ez2view/NemSight show data; trader still does analysis manually |
| **Genie NL→SQL** | 6 spaces turning plain English into governed SQL over gold tables | No incumbent has natural language data access |
| **Predictive ML models** | Independent price spike and demand forecasts (XGBoost) — not just AEMO pre-dispatch relay | NemSight/ez2view are purely retrospective display tools |
| **NL trade entry** | "Buy 50MW NSW Q3 flat at $85" creates a real trade via AI Market Intelligence | No ETRM supports conversational deal capture |
| **Unified lakehouse** | Single medallion architecture: market data → analytics → trading → risk → settlement | Incumbents are siloed products (NemSight + SimEnergy + EnergyOffer = 3 separate systems) |
| **Open data / no lock-in** | Delta Lake + Unity Catalog — data accessible via SQL, Python, any BI tool | Incumbent vendors lock data in proprietary schemas |
| **Forward curve engine** | Transparent bootstrap from ASX futures with seasonal shaping, stored as versioned Delta tables | SimEnergy "calibration" is a black box |
| **Cost structure** | Runs on existing Databricks compute — no per-seat ETRM license | Allegro/EOT/SimEnergy charge $50K–$500K+/yr |

### 13.3 Competitive Gap Features by Phase

The following features close specific gaps identified against incumbents. Each is tagged with the vendor(s) that currently offer the capability.

#### Phase 1 Competitive Gap Features

# Phase 2: Lightweight ETRM — Trading & Risk

**Estimated Duration:** 12-16 weeks (following Phase 1 completion)
**Prerequisites:** Phase 1 fully operational (data pipelines, dashboard, AI Market Intelligence, Genie)

---

## 14. Phase 2 — Executive Summary

Phase 2 transforms AUS Energy AI Market Intelligence from a market intelligence tool into an active **trading support platform** by adding deal capture, portfolio tracking, forward curve management, risk analytics, PPA valuation, and FCAS market support. This directly addresses the gentailer workflow: traders can now ask the AI "what's my exposure?" — not just "what's the market doing?"

The phase targets the core gap identified in Phase 1 for gentailer customers like Alinta Energy and Energy Australia: connecting market intelligence to **portfolio positions**.

---

## 15. Phase 2 — Product Scope

### 15.1 Deal Capture & Portfolio Management

#### Deal Capture UI
- **Trade entry forms** in Streamlit for common NEM contract types:
  - Spot exposure (generation/load positions by region)
  - OTC forwards and swaps (flat, peak, off-peak, super-peak profiles)
  - Futures (ASX Energy futures — base, peak, cap contracts)
  - Options (caps, floors, collars on NEM regional prices)
  - Power Purchase Agreements (fixed price, CPI-escalated, floor/cap, pay-as-produced, baseload-shaped)
  - Renewable Energy Certificates (LGCs, STCs)
- **AI-assisted deal entry**: AI Market Intelligence can create trades from natural language ("Enter a 50MW peak swap for VIC Q3 2026 at $85/MWh")
- **Bulk import** via CSV upload for existing portfolio migration
- **Trade amendment and cancellation** with full audit trail

#### Portfolio Views
- **Position summary**: Net long/short by region, time bucket (month, quarter, year), and contract type
- **Portfolio P&L**: Realized + unrealized, broken down by trade, region, and contract type
- **Exposure heatmap**: Visual grid of MW exposure by region x time period, color-coded by direction and size
- **Trade blotter**: Filterable/sortable list of all trades with status, counterparty, volume, price, and current MtM value

#### Data Model (Lakebase)

| Table | Key Columns | Purpose |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| `trades` | trade_id, trade_type, region, buy_sell, volume_mw, price, start_date, end_date, profile, status, counterparty, created_by, created_at | Master trade record |
| `trade_legs` | leg_id, trade_id, settlement_date, interval_start, interval_end, volume_mw, price, profile_factor | Time-bucketed trade cashflows |
| `trade_amendments` | amendment_id, trade_id, field_changed, old_value, new_value, amended_by, amended_at | Audit trail |
| `counterparties` | counterparty_id, name, credit_rating, credit_limit | Counterparty master |
| `portfolios` | portfolio_id, name, owner, description | Portfolio groupings |
| `portfolio_trades` | portfolio_id, trade_id | Many-to-many mapping |

### 15.2 Forward Curve Construction & Mark-to-Market

#### Forward Curve Engine
- **Base curve sources**: ASX Energy futures settlement prices (daily), broker quotes (OTC forwards)
- **Curve building methodology**:
  - Bootstrap from liquid futures maturities (monthly, quarterly)
  - Shape to hourly granularity using historical load-shape profiles (peak/off-peak/super-peak ratios)
  - Apply seasonal shaping factors derived from 3-year historical price patterns
  - Solar and wind cannibalization adjustments for renewable capture price curves
- **Curve storage**: Versioned in Delta Lake (`gold.forward_curves`) with daily snapshots for historical MtM
- **Curve visualization**: Interactive term structure chart in dashboard

#### Mark-to-Market (MtM) Valuation
- **Daily MtM batch job**: Values entire portfolio against latest forward curves
- **MtM methodology**:
  - Forwards/swaps: Sum of (forward price − contract price) × volume × discount factor per settlement period
  - Options: Black-76 model for European-style caps/floors; intrinsic + time value decomposition
  - PPAs: Hourly cashflow projection using shaped forward curves × forecast generation profile, discounted to NPV
  - RECs: Current spot/forward LGC price × certificate volume
- **P&L attribution**: Decompose daily P&L change into price move, volume change, curve roll, new trades, and time decay
- **Results stored** in `gold.portfolio_mtm` and `gold.pnl_attribution`

### 15.3 Risk Analytics

#### Portfolio Risk Metrics
- **Net position by region and time bucket**: Real-time calculation from trade legs vs generation/load forecasts
- **Portfolio Greeks**:
  - Delta: MW sensitivity to $1/MWh price move per region
  - Gamma: Second-order price sensitivity (relevant for option positions)
  - Vega: Sensitivity to implied volatility changes
  - Theta: Time decay on option positions
- **Value at Risk (VaR)**: Parametric VaR (95%, 99% confidence) using historical volatility by region
- **Stress testing**: Pre-defined scenarios:
  - "SA heatwave" (SA price +300%, demand +20%)
  - "Wind drought" (wind gen -80% across NEM for 48 hours)
  - "Coal trip" (2GW unplanned outage in NSW)
  - "Interconnector failure" (Heywood or QNI capacity = 0)
  - Custom user-defined scenarios

#### Credit Risk
- Counterparty exposure tracking against credit limits
- Alerts when exposure exceeds 80% of credit limit
- Counterparty exposure aging (current, 30-day, 90-day)

### 15.4 PPA Valuation AI

#### AI-Powered PPA Analysis
- **AI PPA tool**: `value_ppa(strike_price, term_years, technology, region, profile, escalation, volume_mw)`
- **Valuation approach**:
  - Project hourly generation profile using technology-specific shape (solar, wind) and regional capacity factors
  - Apply shaped forward curves to calculate merchant revenue baseline
  - Calculate PPA cashflows: (strike price − merchant price) × forecast generation per hour
  - Discount to NPV using configurable WACC
  - Run Monte Carlo simulation (1,000 paths) varying price, generation, and correlation to produce NPV distribution
- **Key outputs**: Expected NPV, P10/P50/P90 NPV range, breakeven strike price, capture price discount, annual cashflow profile
- **AI conversation example**:
  > "Value a 10-year solar PPA in SA at $55/MWh with 2.5% CPI escalation, 100MW nameplate"
  >
  > AI returns NPV range, capture price analysis, sensitivity table, and recommendation

### 15.5 FCAS Market Analytics

### 15.14 Phase 2 — Competitive Gap Feature Details

#### Pre-Trade Credit Checks (E12)

Pre-trade credit validation integrated into the deal capture workflow:

- **Exposure calculation**: Current exposure = sum of MTM on open trades + accrued settlement receivables/payables, per counterparty
- **Proposed trade impact**: Estimated exposure increment using notional × duration × historical volatility multiplier
- **Check points**:
  - On deal entry form submission: validate proposed trade won't breach limit
  - Real-time: recalculate after each MtM refresh (EOD or intraday)
- **Threshold alerts**:
  - 80% utilization → amber warning (proceed with acknowledgment)
  - 90% utilization → red warning (proceed requires risk manager override)
  - 100% utilization → hard block (trade rejected, risk manager notified)
- **API**: `GET /api/credit/check?counterparty_id=X&notional=Y&tenor=Z` — returns pass/warn/block with utilization %
- **Frontend**: Inline credit status indicator on DealCapture.tsx deal form, color-coded gauge on Portfolio.tsx counterparty view

#### Configurable Deal Approval Workflows (E13)

Rule-based approval engine for trade lifecycle events:

- **Approval rules table** (`gold.approval_rules`):
  - Columns: rule_id, event_type (trade_create, trade_amend, trade_cancel, limit_change), condition_field, condition_operator, condition_value, required_approvers, escalation_timeout_hours
  - Example: `event_type=trade_create AND notional_aud > 1000000 → require [senior_trader, risk_manager]`
- **Workflow states**: Draft → Pending Approval → Approved / Rejected → Executed / Archived
- **Notification**: Email + Slack to designated approvers with one-click approve/reject links
- **Escalation**: Auto-escalate to next-level approver if no action within configurable timeout
- **API**: `POST /api/approvals/submit`, `PUT /api/approvals/{id}/approve`, `PUT /api/approvals/{id}/reject`
- **Frontend**: Approval queue panel on TradeBlotter.tsx, approval history on each trade detail view

#### Portfolio NL What-If Analysis (E14)

Natural language scenario analysis via AI Market Intelligence:

- **AI tool**: `portfolio_what_if(scenario_description: str, portfolio: str)` → structured impact assessment
- **Scenario types supported**:
  - Market moves: "What if NSW price increases 20% for Q3?"
  - New trades: "What if I add a 100MW solar PPA in QLD at $50?"
  - Weather events: "What if SA has a week of 40°C+ temperatures?"
  - Infrastructure: "What if Heywood interconnector goes down for 3 days?"
- **Analysis engine**:
  1. Parse NL scenario into parameter adjustments (price shifts, volume changes, weather overrides)
  2. Re-run forward curve with adjusted inputs
  3. Re-value portfolio under adjusted curves
  4. Calculate delta P&L, delta VaR, delta exposure vs. base case
- **Output**: Impact summary table (P&L change, VaR change, worst-affected positions), confidence range, suggested hedging actions
- **Example**: "What happens to my portfolio if gas hits $15/GJ and SA has a 45°C day?"
  > "Under this scenario, your portfolio P&L would decrease by approximately $320K (±$80K). SA short positions would lose $450K, partially offset by QLD long gains of $130K. VaR increases from $1.2M to $1.8M. Consider adding 20MW of SA peak cover to reduce exposure."

#### Predictive Constraint Analytics (E15)

ML model forecasting transmission constraint binding:

- **Model**: Gradient boosted classifier (XGBoost) per major constraint equation
- **Features**: Regional demand forecasts, generation mix forecasts, wind/solar forecasts, interconnector scheduled flows, planned outage schedule, temperature forecasts, time-of-day/day-of-week
- **Target**: Binary (binding/not binding) per constraint per dispatch interval, 4-48 hours ahead
- **Training data**: Historical constraint binding data from `gold.nem_constraints_binding` (2+ years)
- **Output**: Probability of binding per constraint per interval, stored in `gold.constraint_forecasts`
- **Dashboard**: Constraint forecast panel on Live Market tab — show predicted binding constraints as overlay
- **AI tool**: `get_constraint_forecast(region, horizon_hours)` — returns top constraints likely to bind with probability and expected price impact
- **Alerts**: Push notification when high-probability binding event predicted (>80% confidence) for constraints known to cause price separation

# Phase 4: Network Operations & Distribution Intelligence

**Estimated Duration:** 14-20 weeks (following Phase 3 completion)
**Prerequisites:** Phase 1 operational (market data, forecasting, AI Market Intelligence)

---

## 18. Phase 4 — Executive Summary

Phase 4 extends AUS Energy AI Market Intelligence beyond the wholesale market to serve **Distribution Network Service Providers (DNSPs)** — the poles-and-wires businesses that deliver electricity to homes and businesses. This phase adds network asset monitoring, DER (Distributed Energy Resource) visibility, outage analytics, regulatory compliance dashboards, and network planning tools. It positions the platform for a new customer segment: DNSPs like Ausgrid, Endeavour Energy, SA Power Networks, Ergon Energy, CitiPower/Powercor, and AusNet Services.

DNSPs face mounting pressure from rooftop solar proliferation, battery adoption, EV charging load growth, and increasing AEMO/AER regulatory requirements. Their existing SCADA/ADMS systems generate vast volumes of data but lack the AI-driven analytics layer to convert network telemetry into actionable intelligence. AUS Energy AI Market Intelligence fills this gap by bringing lakehouse analytics, AI forecasting, and a conversational AI to the distribution network.
