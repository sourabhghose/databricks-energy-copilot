Pipeline 20: ESV Regulations & Victorian Electrical Safety Framework

Ingests the Victorian electrical safety regulatory framework:
1. Key Acts and Regulations (metadata from ESV website)
2. ESV Orders and Exemptions
3. Compliance requirements per the Electricity Safety Act 1998

Since ESV regulations are legislation (PDFs on legislation.vic.gov.au),
this pipeline maintains a structured register of regulatory instruments
and their compliance requirements.
