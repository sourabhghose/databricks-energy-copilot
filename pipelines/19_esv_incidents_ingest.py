Pipeline 19: ESV Incident Reports & Safety Data Ingestion

Ingests Energy Safe Victoria (ESV) electrical incident data from public reports.
ESV publishes:
1. Annual Electrical Safety Performance Reports (PDF with tables)
2. Ad-hoc incident investigation reports
3. Safety statistics by distribution business

Since ESV data is primarily in PDF format, this pipeline:
- Scrapes the ESV website for report metadata and links
- Extracts structured data from known ESV annual reports
- Seeds historical incident/safety data from published statistics

Target tables:
- energy_copilot_catalog.gold.esv_incidents
- energy_copilot_catalog.gold.esv_safety_performance

Schedule: Weekly (Monday 10am AEST)
